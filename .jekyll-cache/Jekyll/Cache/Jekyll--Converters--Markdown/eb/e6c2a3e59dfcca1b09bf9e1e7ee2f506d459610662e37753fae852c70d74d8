I"ç<p>I wanted to share some thoughts on designing for internal (caseworker) services in gov as I‚Äôve heard from many people, in many departments, across multiple projects that the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> is not suitable for internal/caseworker products, usually followed with something about the recommendation to start with one thing per page.</p>
